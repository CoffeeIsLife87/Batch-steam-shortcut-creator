IT WORKS!!!

requires python 3 and 2 (https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.2/python-3.8.2.exe) (https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.17/python-2.7.17.amd64.msi)

I used python 3.8.2 but I think and python 3.7.x will work

I want to add an application blacklist for setup apps (I.E. Crashreporter64, Prerequsitesetup) so if you know how to do that please let me know

I use https://github.com/CorporalQuesadilla/Steam-Shortcut-Manager for setting the shortcuts
