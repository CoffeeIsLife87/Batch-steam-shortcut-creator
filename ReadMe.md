IT WORKS!!!

requires python 3 and 2 (https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.2/python-3.8.2.exe) (https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.17/python-2.7.17.amd64.msi)

make sure you choose "add python to path" when installing

I used python 3.8.2 but I think and python 3.7.x will work

now it adds icons

I use [shortcut manager](https://github.com/CorporalQuesadilla/Steam-Shortcut-Manager) as well as [documentation]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) for setting the shortcuts

VR support is added (fixed not working for some games)
