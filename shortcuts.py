# Name:        Steam Shortcut Manager
# Purpose:     Command line tool to add non-Steam application shortcuts.
#              Intended to be used in conjunction with a tool that automates the adding of shortcuts.
#              In addition to adding the shortcut, the steam://rungameid/### is returned.
#              Close Steam before running!
#
#              Should be cross-platform with Linux/Mac/Windows.
#
#              I might make a GUI, or support removing shortcuts at some point. For now, it just adds shortcuts.
#
#              Oh, and you NEED to have an existing shortcuts.vdf - basically, add at least one non-steam shortcut via the GUI.
#              This is an incredibly simple fix for me to implement, I'm just lazy.
#
#              For more information, I'll probably document the file format itself somewhere on a github wiki page sometime.
#              https://github.com/CorporalQuesadilla/Steam-Shortcut-Manager/wiki
#
# Usage:       Run from commandline. Needs the following arguments in this order:
#              Argument                 Explanation
#              --------                 -----------
#              Path to Shortcuts.vdf    Requires Your personal ID - steamID3 [U:1:THIS_PART_HERE_COPY_ME] from https://steamidfinder.com/
#                                           This is for the local path to your shortcuts.vdf file we're modifying,
#                                           located in \Path\To\Steam\userdata\USERIDHERE\config\shortcuts.vdf. Use double quotes.
#              Name of program          Whatever you want to call it. In double quotes if it has spaces or other funky characters
#              Path to program or URL   In double quotes if the path has spaces or other funky characters
#              Path to start program    Basically the folder it's in (use double quotes)
#              Path to icon             Optional place to source the icon. In double quotes. BTW, I'm not sure where the Grid/BigPicture image comes from
#              Shortcut path            No idea what this is. Just do "" (literally 'the empty string' - two double quotes in a row)
#              Launch options           Probably needs double quotes if you got any spaces or other funky characters in there
#              Hidden?                  Put a 1 here to make it only visible under "Hidden", anything else won't hide it. You need something though. 0 is fine.
#              Allow Desktop Config?    Use controller's Desktop Configurations in this game. Put a 1 to enable it, anything else to disable. You need something though. 0 is fine.
#              Allow Steam Overlay?     Put a 1 to enable it, anything else to disable. You need something though. 0 is fine.
#              In VR library?           For the 'VR Library' Category. Put a 1 to enable it, anything else to disable. You need something though. 0 is fine.
#              Last Play Time           Date last played. No idea how this works yet. For now, put 0 and I'll take care of it (mark it as "Never Played")
#              Categories               Any categories you want it to appear in. If you use spaces in a category name, put it in double quotes
#
#              Example:
#              python shortcuts.py "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\ID_HERE\config\shortcuts.vdf" WoohooMyProgramWorks C:\d.exe C:\ "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\bin\steamservice.exe" "" WHATUPLAUNCH 0 1 1 1 0 tag1 tag2
